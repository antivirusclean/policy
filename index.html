        <h1>Antivirus Free Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h3>What information we gather and use</h3>
        <p>Our team respects your desire to protect personal information. This page tells you what sort of information we may ask you for, and in what situations, when using Antivirus Free.</p>
        <p>You make all decisions regarding whether or not to proceed with any activity that requests personal information. However, please note that if you do not wish to provide the requested information, you may not be able to receive Antivirus Free’s protection.</p>
        <h3>Information that Antivirus Free collects</h3>
        <h5>1. Device information</h5>
        <p>When you use Antivirus Free services, our servers automatically record certain information about your mobile device. This information may include an equipment identifier (e.g., IMEI, UDID), subscriber identifier (e.g., IMSI), device name, mobile phone number, device type and manufacturer, operating system type and version, wireless carrier / operator, network type, country of origin, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the dates and times of your requests. We use this information to provide our services, and support if needed, and to create de-identified or aggregate information about our users.</p>
        <h5>2. Information about general user behaviors</h5>
        <p>We use analytics software so that we can improve the features and usability of our products. This software might analyze information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, and where the application was downloaded. We may also use such information to show you relevant content and suggest new features, products and services that can enhance your user experience with Antivirus Free. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile app.</p>
        <h5>3. Location information</h5>
        <p>Some security features we offer work better if we know what area you are in. Antivirus Free might collect location information in two ways. We may receive it directly from your mobile device or in some situations, we may receive location data from cell tower or Wi-Fi hotspot information.</p>
        <h5>4. Information about scans and scan results</h5>
        <p>Antivirus Free features, which are available on different platforms, help protect your device from malware and spyware. They scan files and applications after you install Antivirus Free and as new applications are installed or accessed to detect any threats to you and your mobile device. They also automatically scan your entire device periodically, and regularly update your threat definitions. In order to perform these functions, we need to collect information about the applications and files present on your device, the results of any scans performed by our services, and actions you take as a result of scanning.</p>
        <h5>5. Safe Browsing / URLs</h5>
        <p>Safe Browsing is a feature available when using the Android default browser, the Chrome browser and other supported browsers. Safe Browsing is designed to identify and warn you of unsafe websites so that you can choose to avoid visiting them. It scans URLs that you visit on supported browsers.</p>
        <p>To provide the Safe Browsing service, we may transmit the URLs you receive or visit on your phone to a Antivirus Free provided or third-party service to determine if those URLs are unsafe (e.g., if the URLs contain phishing attacks, malwares, or exploits). If a URL you visit is determined to be unsafe, we store a record of the unsafe URL.</p>
        <h3>How we use the information the application collects</h3>
        <p>We are committed to only collecting the information necessary to provide and improve Antivirus Free’s services. When we do collect your information, we store it and associate it with your account unless otherwise noted. We take your privacy very seriously and will only use and disclose this information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>Note that some of our products are standalone products, collect only limited information or no information at all. Not every section of this Privacy Policy will apply to these products.</p>
        <h5>1. Protect your privacy</h5>
        <p>We would never sell your personal information to any other third-parties. All non-personal information we collect is used to create a better application. Our team is committed to protect your privacy. Meanwhile, to make sure your personal information is secure; we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to all employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.</p>
        <h5>2. With whom the information might be shared</h5>
        <p>Personal data is used solely for providing the requested service unless you've given your consent to receive any type of marketing information described above. Please be advised that we may disclose your personal information if legally required to do so by government agencies, judicial courts or law enforcement bodies, or to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal.</p>
        <h3>Contact details</h3>
        <p>If you have any questions or suggestions regarding the protection of your personal data, please contact us at <a>poohcohn@gmail.com</a>.</p>
        <p>We will update Privacy Policy regularly based on our product development. When we change the policy, an updated link will be published on our website. Please check out our link for the updates.</p>
